When you walk through a forest, you might see trees as solitary individuals, competing for space and sunlight. However, look a little deeper—specifically underground—and you will find that the forest is actually a massive, interconnected superorganism.

Scientists call this the **Mycorrhizal Network**, but it is more affectionately known as the "Wood Wide Web."

## Image Examples

Here are examples of how to include images in articles:

## The Hidden Infrastructure

Beneath the forest floor lies a complex web of fungi called **mycelium**. These are not the mushrooms you see on the surface (which are merely the "fruit" of the fungus), but rather tiny, thread-like filaments that spread across miles of soil.

> **Key Concept:** Mycorrhiza (from Greek _mykes_ for fungus and _rhiza_ for root) describes the symbiotic relationship where fungi attach themselves to the roots of plants.

This relationship is a masterclass in biological trade:

1.  **The Fungi provide:** Hard-to-access soil nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, along with water.
2.  **The Trees provide:** Sugar (carbon), which the trees produce via photosynthesis.

Since the fungi live underground and cannot photosynthesize, they rely on the trees for energy. In exchange, the fungi act as an extended root system for the trees.

### The Chemical Exchange

The process begins in the leaves of the trees. Through photosynthesis, trees convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) using sunlight.

$$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$

The trees then send this sugar ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) down to their roots to trade with the fungi.

## What Happens on the Network?

This physical connection allows for something startlingly human: **communication and altruism.** Trees use this fungal internet to share resources and information.

### 1. The "Mother Trees"

The largest, oldest trees in the forest act as hubs. These **"Mother Trees"** are connected to hundreds of other trees.

- **Childcare:** Mother trees can distinguish their own kin from other species. They reduce their own root spread to make room for their saplings and pump sugar through the network to feed them while they are too small to reach the sunlight.
- **Legacy:** When a Mother Tree is dying, she will dump her remaining resources into the network, passing her carbon legacy on to the next generation before she falls.

### 2. Warning Systems

If a tree is attacked by pests (like aphids or beetles), it releases chemical signals through its roots into the network. Neighboring trees detect these signals and begin raising their own chemical defenses—producing toxic compounds or bad-tasting enzymes—before the bugs even reach them.

### 3. Cross-Species Support

It isn’t just about family. In mixed forests, paper birch and Douglas fir trees have been seen trading carbon back and forth depending on the season.

- **Summer:** The birch has leaves and blocks the sun, so it sends carbon to the shaded fir.
- **Winter:** The birch loses its leaves, and the evergreen fir returns the favor, sending carbon back to the birch.

## The Dark Side of the Network

Like the human internet, the Wood Wide Web has its hackers and cyber-criminals.

- **The Black Walnut:** This tree releases toxic chemicals through the network to sabotage and kill rival plants nearby.
- **The Orchid:** Some orchids are "hackers" that tap into the system and steal resources without providing anything in return (a process called myco-heterotrophy).

## Why This Matters

Understanding the Wood Wide Web changes how we view conservation. We can no longer manage forests by simply counting trees or cutting down "competitors."

> A forest is not a collection of objects; it is a community. Removing the oldest trees (the hubs) can cause the entire network to unravel, leaving the remaining forest vulnerable to disease and drought.

Next time you lean against an old oak tree, remember: it is likely in the middle of a conversation.

## Code Examples

Here are some code examples showing different syntax highlighting features:

### Inline

This is a highlighted inline code: `console.log("hello world"){:js}`.

### Basic (with Breakout)

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```ts breakout
// Using 'typeof' to infer types
const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
type PersonType = typeof person; // { name: string; age: number }

// 'satisfies' to ensure a type matches but allows more specific types
type Animal = { name: string };
const dog = { name: 'Buddy', breed: 'Golden Retriever' } satisfies Animal;

// Generics with 'extends' and default values
function identity<T extends number | string = string>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let str = identity(); // Default type is string
let num = identity(42); // T inferred as number

// 'extends' with interface and class
interface HasLength {
  length: number;
}

function logLength<T extends HasLength = string>(arg: T): void {
  console.log(arg.length);
}

logLength('Hello'); // OK: string has length (default is string)
logLength([1, 2, 3]); // OK: array has length
// logLength(123);    // Error: number doesn't have length

// 'typeof' with functions
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

type AddFunctionType = typeof add; // (x: number, y: number) => number

// Generic interfaces with 'extends' and default types
interface Box<T extends object = { message: string }> {
  content: T;
}

let defaultBox: Box = { content: { message: 'Hello' } }; // Uses default type
let customBox: Box<{ status: number }> = { content: { status: 200 } };

// Complex example with 'satisfies' and default generics
type Task = {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  completed: boolean;
};

const myTask = {
  title: 'Learn TypeScript',
  completed: false,
  priority: 'High',
} satisfies Task; // Allows priority but ensures Task structure

// Generic function with default type
function wrapInArray<T = string>(value: T): T[] {
  return [value];
}

const stringArray = wrapInArray(); // Default to string
const numberArray = wrapInArray(42); // T inferred as number

/**
 * Combines two generic types into a tuple.
 *
 * @template T - The first type.
 * @template U - The second type.
 * @param {T} first - The first value.
 * @param {U} second - The second value.
 * @returns {[T, U]} A tuple containing both values.
 */
function combine<T, U>(first: T, second: U): [T, U] {
  return [first, second];
}
```

### With Title

```js title="My Script"
console.log('Hello World');
```

### With Line Numbers

```ts lineNumbers
const a = 'Hello World';
console.log(a);
```

### Highlighted Lines

```tsx
// highlight a line
<div>Hello World</div> // [!code highlight]
```

### Word Highlighting

```tsx
// highlight a word
// [!code word:Fumadocs]
<div>Fumadocs</div>
```

### Diff Styles

```tsx
console.log('hewwo'); // [!code --]
console.log('hello'); // [!code ++]
```

### Focus

```tsx
const observer = new ResizeObserver(() => {
  console.log('Element resized'); // [!code focus]
})
return observer
observer.observe(element);
```

### Tab Groups

```ts tab="Tab 1"
console.log('A');
```

```ts tab="Tab 2"
console.log('B');
```
