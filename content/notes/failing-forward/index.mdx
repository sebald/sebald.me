The way we usually talk about design systems, you'd think they are just a collection of well-organized artifacts. Here's the Figma library. Here's the component repo. Here are the design tokens. Everything labeled, everything documented, everything in its place. It feels good to organize these things. It is clean, organized and manageable. It feels like control.

But that feeling is an illusion.

Over four years, my team and I built a design system for a product with over 20 years of history and all the legacy baggage that comes with it. Most of the assumptions we started with turned out to be wrong. But each time one broke, it pushed us somewhere better.

## The territory we inherited

The product was capable. Really capable. But you wouldn't know it by looking at it. The UI felt dated. If you judged the product by its interface, as most people do, you would severely underestimate what it could do.

This wasn't a failure of effort. Teams were working hard. But they were spending most of their energy extinguishing fires caused by decisions made years earlier. Technical debt had compounded to the point where even small UI changes felt risky. "We can't build that" became a reflex. Not because the developers lacked skill, but because the tooling and the codebase had made ambition expensive. Designers kept pushing forward. The codebase kept holding everyone back.

The plan was to split the monolithic software into multiple standalone products. The hope was that this would bring both technical and organizational benefits. Smaller codebases, independent teams, modern stacks. A design system seemed like the natural foundation for this new world. Shared components, shared language, shared quality.

1. Intro (done) → rug pull
2. The territory we inherited — Reservix context, the mess, "we can't build that"
3. Building the map — component library, greenfield win, we thought we nailed it
4. Crickets — nobody cares, people problem not tech problem
5. Meeting them where they were — the pivot, internal sales, paving desire paths
6. The trap — adoption grows, numbers look great... but inconsistency remains
7. Bricks without blueprints — components vs patterns, this is where "map is not the territory" hits
8. What a design system actually is — the real definition, the service mindset
9. Failing forward — the takeaways
