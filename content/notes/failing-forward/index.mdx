The way we usually talk about design systems, you'd think they are just a collection of well-organized artifacts. Here's the Figma library. Here's the component repo. Here are the design tokens. Everything labeled, everything documented, everything in its place. It feels good to organize these things. It is clean, organized and manageable. It feels like control.

But that feeling is an illusion.

Over four years, my team and I built a design system for a product with over 20 years of history and all the legacy baggage that comes with it. Most of the assumptions we started with turned out to be wrong. But each time one broke, it pushed us somewhere better.

## The territory we inherited

The product was capable. Really capable. But you wouldn't know it by looking at it. The UI felt dated. If you judged the product by its interface, as most people do, you would severely underestimate what it could do.

This wasn't a failure of effort. Teams were working hard. But they were spending most of their energy extinguishing fires caused by decisions made years earlier. Technical debt had compounded to the point where even small UI changes felt risky. "We can't build that" became a reflex. Not because the developers lacked skill, but because the tooling and the codebase had made ambition expensive. Designers kept pushing forward. The codebase kept holding everyone back.

Something had to give. The plan was to split the monolithic software into multiple standalone products. The hope was that this would bring both technical and organizational benefits. Smaller codebases, independent teams, modern stacks. A design system seemed like the natural foundation for this new world. Shared components, shared language, shared quality.

## Building the map

So we put together a small team to build the foundation. We bootstrapped a component library with a modern tech stack. The design was based on a previous exploration that had already been approved but never made it into production. We could focus entirely on building.

Around the same time, one of the product teams was about to rebuild their product from the ground up. We jumped on the opportunity. A greenfield environment. No legacy constraints. No compromises. The perfect test case.

And it worked. The pilot team delivered something we were genuinely proud of. Components that used to take days to build from scratch were now available out of the box. There were growing pains, but that was expected. We had proven that the approach could work. We high-fived each other and prepared to roll it out to the rest of the company.

## Crickets

We had proven it could work. We had a real product to point at. But the rest of the company wasn't interested. The plan to split the monolith into standalone products never gained traction. The majority of the company was still fully invested in the legacy system, and there was no sign of that changing. We hadn't anticipated this. We had built for a future that the organization wasn't moving toward.

When we showed up with our shiny new component library, our colleagues looked at their workload and said "I don't have time to learn this." They weren't being difficult. They were being rational. The cost of adopting something new felt impossibly high when you're already struggling to keep up.

## Meeting them where they were

We had to rethink everything. Our entire approach assumed that teams would come to us once they saw what was possible. That assumption was wrong. If they couldn't come to us, we had to go to them.

We brought the design system into the legacy system. We matched the visual style so that anything built with the new components was indistinguishable from the old code. Under the hood, developers were working with modern tools.

Then we focused on making the transition as painless as possible for colleagues. We wrote guides. We gave training sessions. We improved their dev environments. Small things, but small things add up.

Most importantly, we showed up. We sat with teams. We helped them through their first components, their first pages, their first bugs. We weren't a library they could install. We were a team they could call.

## The trap

It worked. The narrative slowly shifted from "we can't build that" to "we can build that... most likely." One team after another started using the design system. It spread on its own. In product demos, more and more features were being built with our components. The numbers looked great.

So yay! We did it! ...right?

Not quite. The adoption numbers looked great, but teams were still building inconsistent interfaces. Same buttons, same inputs, same building blocks. The pages they built with them looked nothing alike.

Our colleagues knew how to use the components. They were productive. But knowing how to use a component is not the same as knowing how to combine them. The system itself had little opinion about how things should come together. Teams approached the same user flows differently. They all used the same components and arrived at results that were close, but never quite consistent.

So we pivoted again. We overhauled the documentation. We shifted from describing what components can do to explaining how to combine them. We focused on patterns. Common use cases, recurring user flows, opinionated guidance about how the pieces fit together.

## The map is not the territory

First we enabled teams to build modern UIs. Then we brought a modern frontend environment into the legacy system and trained our colleagues to work with it. Now we were teaching them how to combine components to build great user experiences. Each step only became visible after the previous one had run its course.

There is a concept that explains why this kept happening: the map is not the territory. The description of a thing is not the thing itself. A road map does not show you the traffic. It sounds obvious, but it is remarkably easy to spend all your energy perfecting the map while losing sight of the territory it is supposed to represent.

Your documentation, your Figma library, your component playground: that is the map. It represents how the UI should look and behave in a clean, theoretical environment. It is organized, it makes sense, it makes you feel like you've got things figured out.

The territory is the reality. Messy CSS overrides in a codebase that has grown for over twenty years. Tight deadlines that force teams to take shortcuts. Habits your colleagues have built up over a decade of doing things a certain way. The political capital it costs to get a refactor approved.

## A design system is a service

Looking back, the most valuable thing we built was not the component library. It was not the documentation or the patterns either.

It was trust.

Every pivot forced us closer to the people using our system. First we built components and waited for teams to show up. Then we went to their codebases and integrated. Then we sat with them and trained them. Then we listened to what still wasn't working and changed our approach again.

The intro to this article describes design systems as "a collection of well-organized artifacts." That is the map. The territory is that a design system is a service. It is the training session on a Tuesday afternoon. It is the message at 4pm when someone is stuck on a layout. It is the decision to match the legacy style instead of forcing something new. It is showing up, again and again.

Components age. Documentation goes stale. Patterns evolve as the product changes. The service is what carries all of it forward. When teams trust you to show up, to listen, to adapt, they give you the room to get things wrong and try again. That is what kept our design system alive through three pivots. Not the quality of our code, but the relationship we had built with the people using it.

## Failing forward

None of this was planned. We did not sit down at the start and sketch out three pivots. Each one happened because we get stuck. And each time we got stuck, it revealed what the system actually needed to become.

If we hadn't been ignored by the legacy teams, we would never have invested so heavily in developer experience and support. If adoption hadn't produced inconsistent interfaces, we would never have discovered that patterns matter more than components.

The obstacles were not in the way. They were the way.

Building a design system is not a straight line from a Figma file to a component library to a dashboard full of adoption metrics. It is an ongoing conversation between what you think teams need and what they actually need. The only way to learn the difference is to get it wrong, listen, and adjust.

We are still adjusting. The story doesn't have a tidy ending because the territory keeps changing. But we have stopped mistaking the map for the destination.
