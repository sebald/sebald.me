Here are spots where the writing feels a bit too tidy and could use more of your actual voice:

Opening paragraph (lines 9-10): "It feels good to organize these things. It is clean, structured and manageable. You feel in control."
This reads like a presentation slide. You could let yourself be more blunt or self-deprecating about the satisfaction of organizing
things. The rhythm is very even, almost too composed for the point you're making.

"But it's an illusion." (line 11): This lands like a keynote punchline. It's doing the dramatic one-liner thing that a lot of design
system talks do. You could say something that feels more like you actually thinking out loud rather than performing a reveal.

"Something had to give." (line 23): Another clean transition sentence. It summarizes neatly when you could instead let the reader feel
the mess a bit more before you move on.

"And it worked." (line 31): Same pattern. You keep using these punchy short sentences as structural pivots. Once or twice is great, but
by the third or fourth time it starts to feel like a formula.

"So yay! We did it! ...right?" (line 53): This is the one place you try to be casual, but it feels a bit forced because the rest of the
piece is so controlled. If the whole thing had more of this energy, this line would land better.

"It was trust." (line 65): The biggest "clean" moment. You build up to it like a TED talk reveal. The insight is genuinely good, but the
delivery wraps it in a bow. What if you let it be messier, like you're still figuring out why it mattered?

The closing paragraph (lines 72-73): "It is an ongoing conversation between what you think teams need and what they actually need." This
summarizes the whole piece a little too neatly. You've earned the reader's attention by now. You don't need to hand them the thesis on
a plate.

General pattern: You tend to use the structure "We did X. It didn't work. So we did Y." repeatedly. It's clear, but it's also very
controlled storytelling. Real experience is usually less sequential. Letting some of that non-linearity or uncertainty bleed through
would make the whole thing feel less like a retrospective and more like you're still in it.

The strongest, most natural writing in the piece is in the middle sections (lines 37-47), where you're describing what you actually did
with teams. That's where your voice comes through. The beginning and end are where it gets "writerly."
